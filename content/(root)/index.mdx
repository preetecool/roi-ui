## About

Roi UI is a modern, accessible, and customizable UI component library built on top of Base UI. It offers a collection of carefully crafted components that are easy to use, fully accessible, and customizable. Heavily inspired by the architecture of shadcn/ui, Roi UI embraces simplicity and a developer-friendly experience.

Components comes pre-styled, but with full source code available, giving you complete freedom to customize and adapt them to your specific needs.

The name Roi comes from the Greek word ροή (pronounced roí), meaning flow which captures the library's goal of helping developers and users effortlessly get into the flow of things. Like water moving smoothly through a well-designed system. Whether you're building or interacting with an interface, Roi UI aims to make the experience feel natural, fluid, and intuitive.

## BaseUI

Most components in Roi UI are built using [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/) primitives. Base UI was created by contributors from the Radix UI team and is part of the MUI ecosystem, ensuring a solid foundation backed by a strong community. With a focus on long-term maintenance and stability, Base UI provides a reliable and forward-looking core for Roi UI components.

## Motion and Animations


 Bringing delight to the end user is a core philosophy of Roi UI, and Motion helps achieve that. Roi UI components feature motion powered by [Motion](https://motion.dev/) (previously Framer Motion) or CSS animations, with more on the way. Not every component needs to be flashy. Roi UI focuses on subtle, tasteful animations that enhance, not distract.

Thoughtful animations enhance the user experience by providing visual feedback, guiding attention, and making interactions feel more intuitive or natural and polished. They add a sense of liveliness that can transform a good interface into a great one.

## CSS

Roi UI offers both CSS Modules and Tailwind for styling. Whether you prefer traditional scoped CSS or utility classes, we've got you covered. Choose the approach that works best for your workflow.
