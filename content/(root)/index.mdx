## About
roi-ui is a modern, accessible, and customizable UI component library built on top of Base UI. It offers a collection of carefully crafted components that are easy to use, fully accessible, and customizable. Heavily inspired by the architecture of shadcn/ui, roi-ui embraces simplicity and a developer-friendly experience.

Components comes pre-styled, but with full source code available, giving you complete freedom to customize and adapt them to your specific needs.

The name roi comes from the Greek word ροή (pronounced roí), meaning flow which captures the library's goal of helping developers and users effortlessly get into the flow of things. Like water moving smoothly through a well-designed system. Whether you're building or interacting with an interface, roi-ui aims to make the experience feel natural, fluid, and intuitive.



## BaseUI

Most components in roi-ui are built using [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/) primitives. Base UI was created by contributors from the Radix UI team and is part of the MUI ecosystem, ensuring a solid foundation backed by a strong community. With a focus on long-term maintenance and stability, Base UI provides a reliable and forward-looking core for roi-ui components.

## Motion

Components include (or soon will) an example using [Motion](https://motion.dev/) (formerly Framer Motion). Bringing delight to the end user is a core philosophy of roi-ui, and Motion helps achieve that.

Thoughtful animations enhance the user experience by providing visual feedback, guiding attention, and making interactions feel more intuitive and polished. They add a sense of liveliness that can transform a good interface into a great one.

## CSS

roi-ui uses CSS Modules for styling. This decision was made to keep styles easy to understand and modify, especially for developers who prefer traditional, scoped CSS over utility classes. However, Tailwind support is on the roadmap, and future versions of roi-ui will offer seamless integration for Tailwind users as well.
