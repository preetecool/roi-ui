## Prerequisites

roi-ui components are built on top of Base UI. You'll need to install Base UI first to use these components.

## Installation

### 1. Install Base UI


```package-install
@base-ui/react
```

### 2. Set up portals

Add a portal container to your root layout:

<CodeBlock
  filename="layout.tsx"
  language="tsx"
  code={`<body>
  <div className="root">
    {children}
  </div>
</body>`}
/>

### 3. Add global styles

Copy and paste the global CSS variables into your globals.css file:

<GlobalsCSS />

## Your first component

Once you have Base UI set up, you can start using roi-ui components. Here's a simple button example:

<ComponentPreview name="button-demo" />
